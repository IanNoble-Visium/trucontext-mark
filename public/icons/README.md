# Icon Files

This directory should contain PNG icon files for different node types in the graph visualization.

## Required Icons

The following icon files should be placed in this directory:

- server.png
- workstation.png
- user.png
- threatactor.png
- application.png
- database.png
- entity.png
- router.png
- firewall.png
- switch.png
- client.png
- unknown.png (used as fallback)

## Icon Specifications

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: 32x32 pixels (recommended)
- Style: Consistent visual style across all icons

If you don't have these icons, you can:

1. Create them using an image editor
2. Download free icons from sites like [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) or [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
3. Use a placeholder icon generator

## Important Note

The application will attempt to use the unknown.png file as a fallback when specific icons are missing.
